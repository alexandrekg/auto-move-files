# auto-move-files

I made this project to exercises my knowledge with some Python standard libraries such as sys, os, glob, etc.


## How to run:
1.Copy all files from /tmp/ dir to a named_folder
```commandline
python main.py all my-named-folder
```

2.Copy all PDF files from /tmp/ dir to a named_folder
```commandline
python main.py pdf my-named-folder
```

3.Copy all JSON files from /tmp/ dir to a named_folder
```commandline
python main.py json my-named-folder
```

4.If you put another file in /tmp/ dir, you can type that file extension on the execution, example:
- You put a .txt file in the /tmp/ dir
```commandline
python main.py txt my-named-folder
```

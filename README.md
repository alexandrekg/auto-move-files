# auto-move-files

I made this project to exercises my knowledge with some Python standard libraries such as sys, os, glob, etc.


## How to run:
1.Copy all files from /tmp/ dir to a named_folder
```commandline
python main.py all my-named-folder
```

2.Copy all PDF files from /tmp/ dir to a named_folder
```commandline
python main.py pdf my-named-folder
```
